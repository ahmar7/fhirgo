                              which we are withdrawing in this proposed rule.
                              The newly proposed rule considers stakeholder

                                patient data when a patient changes health plans
                                with the patient’s permission. Those data

                                we are considering a proposal that would require
                                this exchange only if the patient opts into data
                                sharing.
